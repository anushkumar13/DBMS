# Types of Databases - Detailed Explanation

## 1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)  
Relational Databases were designed in the 1970s and remain very popular today. They are based on the Relational Model.

Data is stored in tables, similar to Excel sheets. Each table contains rows (records) and columns (fields).

Relationships between tables are created using foreign keys, allowing multiple tables to be joined.

Operations on data use SQL (Structured Query Language), a standard language for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

**Advantages:**  
- Data is highly structured.  
- SQL being a standard language is easy to learn.  
- Strong support for data normalization, reducing data redundancy.  
- Highly optimized for structured data.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Horizontal scaling (spreading database across multiple servers) is difficult.  
- Systems can become complex and slow with very large data volumes.

## 2. Object-Oriented Databases (OODB)  
These databases are based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Data is treated as objects, similar to how it is handled in programming.

Features like inheritance, encapsulation, and object identity are present in these databases.

Handling complex data and relationships is easier.

Data is stored as objects containing all related information, rather than in separate tables.

**Advantages:**  
- Fast and easy data storage and retrieval.  
- Easier to model complex real-world problems.  
- Good integration with OOP languages.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Performance issues due to complexity; read/write operations may be slower.  
- Less popular with smaller community support.  
- Does not support views like relational databases.

## 3. NoSQL Databases  
NoSQL means "Not Only SQL." These databases are non-tabular and use different data models.

Main types include Document, Key-Value, Wide-Column, and Graph databases.

They have schema-free or flexible schemas, meaning data structure is dynamic and can change easily.

They support easy horizontal scaling, making them suitable for big data and applications with high user loads.

Mostly open source.

**Advantages:**  
- Flexible and dynamic schemas.  
- Can handle huge volumes of data (Big Data).  
- Horizontal scaling is easy.  
- Can handle different data types and structures.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- No standard query language; each database has its own query syntax.  
- Data consistency is flexible, often eventual consistency instead of strong consistency.  
- Less efficient with complex queries and joins compared to SQL.

## 4. Hierarchical Databases  
As the name suggests, these databases store data in a tree-like structure.

There is a parent record with multiple child records, but each child has only one parent (one-to-many relationship).

Data fields are simple, with one value per field.

Data traversal starts from the root node and explores the entire tree to retrieve data.

The disk storage structure is also hierarchical, making this model suitable for physical storage.

**Advantages:**  
- Very fast and easy data traversal.  
- Efficient for use cases like drop-down menus and file systems.  
- Adding or deleting data is simple without affecting the entire database.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Cannot handle complex many-to-many relationships.  
- Searching is sequential and can be time-consuming.  
- Data redundancy may increase due to repeated data.

## 5. Network Databases  
Network databases are an extension of hierarchical databases.  

Here, child records can have multiple parents, making the data structure more like a graph.

They handle complex relationships better and are more flexible than hierarchical databases.

However, maintenance is tedious and data retrieval can be slow due to complex links.

They have less community support and are less commonly used today.

**Advantages:**  
- Can manage complex many-to-many relationships effectively.  
- More flexible compared to hierarchical databases.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Difficult maintenance.  
- Slow retrieval due to complex relationships.  
- Limited community support.

## Summary  
- **Relational Databases:** Tables, structured data, SQL, strong consistency, vertical scaling.  
- **Object-Oriented Databases:** Objects, OOP features, complex data handling, slower performance, less popular.  
- **NoSQL Databases:** Flexible schemas, horizontal scaling, suitable for big data, multiple data models.  
- **Hierarchical Databases:** Tree structure, one-to-many, simple and fast but inflexible.  
- **Network Databases:** Graph structure, many-to-many, complex relationships, harder maintenance.
