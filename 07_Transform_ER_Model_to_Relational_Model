# ER Model vs Relational Model: Basic Clarity

Think of both models as kinds of **blueprints**. Their job is to logically represent real-world data, but they do it in different styles.

## 1. ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model):

In this model, we represent real-world objects as **Entities**.

The connections between these entities are shown as **Relationships**.

The data related to entities and relationships are represented as **Attributes**.

**Example:**

In a university, there are students and courses, and students enroll in courses —  
Here, **Student** and **Course** become entities, and **Enrolls** becomes a relationship.

## 2. Relational Model:

In the relational model, data is represented in the form of **tables (relations)**.

Each table contains **rows (tuples)** which show the actual data.

The columns in the table represent **attributes**, defining the features of the data.

---

## What do these two models abstractly represent?

Both models logically represent the real-world environment.

In the ER model, we thoughtfully design what the entities are, what data they have, and how they relate.

In the Relational model, we implement the same idea by creating tables that can be stored in a relational DBMS.

Thus, it is said:

> ER Model and Relational Model both are abstract logical representations of the real-world.

---

## The Main Point: Why is conversion important?

The ER Model represents our **design phase** — like an architect designing a house.

The Relational Model represents our **implementation phase** — like a builder constructing the house based on the design.

So when we want to create a database, we first make an ER diagram (design),  
and then convert that design into a Relational Schema so that actual tables can be created in the DBMS.

This conversion is called:  
**"Mapping ER Model to Relational Model"**

---

## The Design Principles Behind Conversion

You wrote:

> "...because the two models imply similar design principles..."

This is very important.

In both models:

- Entities are uniquely identified (keys in ER, primary keys in Relational).
- Relationships are defined (relationship sets in ER, foreign keys in Relational).
- Attributes have the same role (properties in ER, columns in Relational).
- Data consistency and integrity constraints are important in both.

This means:

The concepts of ER Model and Relational Model match,  
which is why it is easy to convert ER to Relational.

---

## Conclusion (in friendly words)

Bro, understand that ER Model and Relational Model are just different angles of the same picture.  
ER Model shows **“how it should be”**, and Relational Model shows **“how we will implement it”**.

And both share the same goal:

**To store real-world data accurately, logically, and consistently.**

So when you create an ER diagram, it’s not just a design —  
it directly becomes the base for your relational schema.

# Imaginary Story: From ER Diagram to Relational Database Design

Imagine you are building software for a university. You need to create the entire data system — students, teachers, courses, enrollments, exams, and more.

Your first task is to:  
Understand what things exist in the system and how they are connected —  
so you create an **ER Diagram**.

---

## ER Diagram: The Designing Phase

This diagram is like a blueprint where you show:

- **Entities** (like Student, Course, Teacher)  
- **Attributes** (like Student’s name, roll number, date of birth)  
- **Relationships** (like Student “Enrolls” in Course)  

All of this is represented logically in the form of a diagram —  
where you just think about how real-world data looks.

---

## But Bro, Computers Don’t Understand Diagrams!

Your ER Diagram looks great, but a computer or DBMS (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) does not need a diagram —  
it needs:

- Tables with rows and columns  
- Which it can store, process, and query.

---

## And Here Comes the Important Step:

**“Converting an ER Diagram into Table Format”**

This conversion is a formal process where you:

- Convert **Entities** into tables  
- Convert **Attributes** into columns  
- Assign **Primary Keys**  
- Represent **Relationships** using foreign keys or separate tables  
- Break down complex concepts (like multivalued attributes, specialization, generalization) logically into relational format  

This step-by-step mapping is called:  
**“Conversion from ER Model to Relational Database Design”**

---

## Example

In your ER Diagram you show:

- Entity: Student  
  Attributes: RollNo (Primary Key), Name, DOB  

- Entity: Course  
  Attributes: CourseID (Primary Key), Title  

- Relationship: Enrolls  
  Attributes: Date, Grade  

When converted into tables, they become:

**Student Table:**  
| RollNo (PK) | Name | DOB |

**Course Table:**  
| CourseID (PK) | Title |

**Enrolls Table (Relationship Table):**  
| RollNo (FK) | CourseID (FK) | Date | Grade |

---

## Final Understanding in Friendly Words

Bro Anush, when you create an ER diagram, you are preparing a logical model.  
But that is only a design —  
to turn that design into a working database, you need to convert it into tables format.

This process of conversion is called:  
**“Arriving at Relational Database Design from an ER Diagram”**

It’s a crucial step when you actually want to build the database.

# Converting ER Diagram Elements into Tables: Detailed Breakdown

When you convert an ER Diagram into tables, you have to carefully think about each part:

- What is the entity?  
- What are its attributes?  
- Is it weak or strong?  
- Are the attributes single-valued, composite, or multivalued?  
- How are the relationships?  
- Are there any derived attributes or not?  

Then, you put all these elements into the relational database format using tables, columns, primary keys (PK), and foreign keys (FK).

---

## 1. How to Convert a Strong Entity into a Table?

A **strong entity** is one that has its own primary key and does not depend on any other entity.

When converting it into a table:

- The entity name becomes the table name.  
- All its attributes (like name, DOB, roll number) become columns of the table.  
- The primary key (PK) in the entity remains the primary key of the table.  
  For example, if RollNo was the PK in the ER diagram, it remains PK in the table.  
- If this entity is connected to another entity via a relationship (for example, Student enrolls in Course), then foreign keys (FK) are added as needed to establish those relations.

**Short example:**  
Student entity → Table: Student(RollNo, Name, DOB)  
PK = RollNo  
If Student is related to Course, CourseID can be added as FK if required.

---

## 2. How to Convert a Weak Entity into a Table?

A **weak entity** does not have its own primary key and cannot exist without a related strong entity.

When converting a weak entity into a table:

- Include all its attributes in the table.  
- Add the primary key of the corresponding strong entity as a foreign key in this table.  
- Combine this foreign key with the weak entity’s own partial key to form a **composite primary key**.

**Example:**  
Weak entity: Dependent  
Strong entity: Employee  
Attributes: EmpID, DependentName, DOB

Table: Dependent(EmpID, DependentName, DOB)  
Composite PK = {EmpID, DependentName}  
EmpID also acts as FK referencing Employee table.

This means each dependent is uniquely identified only when associated with a particular Employee, so composite key is necessary.

---

## 3. What to Do with Single-Valued Attributes?

Single-valued attributes are those which have only one value per entity (like Name, Age, Salary).

You simply add these as columns in the corresponding table.

For example, if Student has Name and Age, these directly become columns in the Student table.

---

## 4. What to Do with Composite Attributes?

Composite attributes are made up of multiple sub-parts.

For example, Address could be made of {Street, City, Pincode}.

In this case:

- You do **not** create a column called Address.  
- Instead, you break it into its components and add each as a separate column.

**Example:**  
Entity: Customer  
Attribute: Address = {Street, City}

Table: Customer(CustomerID, Name, Address_Street, Address_City)

Here, the composite attribute Address is replaced by its parts as separate columns.

---

## 5. What to Do with Multivalued Attributes?

Multivalued attributes can have multiple values for a single entity.

For example, an Employee can have multiple Dependents.

If you add these directly as columns in the main table, it violates normalization rules.

So instead, you:

- Create a new table named after the multivalued attribute.  
- Include the primary key of the original entity as a foreign key in this new table.  
- Add the multivalued attribute itself as a column.  
- Together, these form a composite primary key for the new table.

**Example:**  
Entity: Employee  
Multivalued attribute: DependentName

New Table: DependentName(EmpID, DName)  
PK = {EmpID, DName}  
FK = EmpID referencing Employee

This way, each dependent of an employee is uniquely represented.

---

## 6. What to Do with Derived Attributes?

Derived attributes are those whose values can be calculated from other attributes.

For example, Age can be derived from Date of Birth (DOB).

Such attributes are **not stored** in the tables because they are redundant and can always be calculated when needed.

You calculate them in queries on the fly.

---

## Final Summary in Simple Words

When you convert an ER Diagram into a relational model, you transform every element according to database table logic:

- Strong entities become normal tables with their own primary keys.  
- Weak entities become tables with composite primary keys that include foreign keys from strong entities.  
- Multivalued attributes get their own tables with composite primary keys.  
- Composite attributes are broken into simple columns.  
- Derived attributes are ignored in the tables and calculated as needed.  
- Single-valued attributes become regular columns.

This process turns your logical ER design into an actual database-ready design.

# Generalisation in Relational Model Conversion

You already know that in generalisation, we take common features and put them in a higher-level (parent) entity, while specialised features go into lower-level (child) entities.

Now, when we design a database and convert an ER diagram into relational tables, the question arises:  
**How do we represent generalisation in tables?**

There are two common methods to do this — **Method 1** and **Method 2**. Each has its own approach and pros and cons.

---

## Method 1: Create a Table for the Higher-Level Entity Too

In this method, we create separate tables for each level — both the parent (higher-level) and the child (lower-level) entities.

- One table for the higher-level (generalised) entity.  
- Separate tables for each lower-level (specialised) entity.

The tables for the lower-level entities will contain:  
- Their own attributes as columns,  
- Plus the primary key of the higher-level entity as a foreign key.

### Example: Banking System

Suppose you have a generalised entity called **Account**, and two specialised entities: **Savings_Account** and **Current_Account**.

The tables would be:

**Table: account**  
Columns: `account_number`, `balance`

**Table: savings_account**  
Columns: `account_number` (foreign key linked to `account`), `interest_rate`, `daily_withdrawal_limit`

**Table: current_account**  
Columns: `account_number` (foreign key linked to `account`), `overdraft_amount`, `per_transaction_charges`

---

### What Does This Mean?

This method maintains the connection between the higher-level and lower-level entities.  
So if you want to look at a savings account record, you first check the `savings_account` table for its `account_number`, then go to the `account` table to see the `balance`.

This design is flexible because if later a new account type comes (like **Student_Account**), you just create a new table for it.

---

## Method 2: Create Tables Only for Lower-Level Entities

This approach is used when:

- Generalisation is **disjoint** (an entity belongs to only one sub-entity),  
- And it is **complete** (every entity in the higher-level must be in some lower-level).

In this case, we **do not create a table for the higher-level entity**.  
We create tables only for the lower-level entities.

Each lower-level table will contain:  
- Its own attributes,  
- Plus **all** attributes of the higher-level entity (meaning attributes are duplicated).

### Using the Same Example:

The tables would be:

**Table: savings_account**  
Columns: `account_number`, `balance`, `interest_rate`, `daily_withdrawal_limit`

**Table: current_account**  
Columns: `account_number`, `balance`, `overdraft_amount`, `per_transaction_charges`

Notice that `balance` (which belonged to the higher-level entity) is duplicated in both tables.

No separate `account` table is created.

---

### What Does This Mean?

This method looks simpler since you create one less table, but...

---

## Drawbacks of Method 2

**Risk of Data Duplication:**  
Since attributes like `balance` are repeated in both tables, if the balance changes, you must update it in multiple places. This causes data redundancy.

**Cannot Handle Overlapping Generalisation:**  
If an entity could belong to multiple sub-entities (overlapping generalisation), this method cannot represent that.

**Cannot Represent Incomplete Generalisation:**  
If some entities belong only to the higher-level entity and not to any sub-entity, there is no table for them in this method.

---

## So, Bro Anush, Which Method to Use and When?

- Use **Method 2** only when generalisation is **disjoint and complete**, but keep its drawbacks in mind.  
- Use **Method 1** when generalisation is **overlapping or incomplete**, because it is more flexible.

---

## One-Line Summary:

- **Method 1:** Both parent and child tables exist; relation maintained with foreign keys.  
- **Method 2:** Only child tables exist; parent attributes are copied in child tables; safe only if generalisation is disjoint and complete.

# Aggregation in DBMS: Simplified Concept

First of all, understand what aggregation means:  

Aggregation means **treating a relationship as if it were an entity**.

This happens when you need to create a new relationship on top of an existing relationship.

In other words, imagine some entities are already related to each other, and now you want to form a new relationship with another entity involving this entire relationship group — this is when you use aggregation.

---

## A Simple Real-Life Example

Suppose you are building a project management system with:

- **Entity 1:** Employee  
- **Entity 2:** Project  
- **Relationship:** Works_On (an employee works on a project)

Now, suppose there is a **Manager** who manages the *employee-project* relationship.

Notice — the manager’s relation is not just with the employee or the project individually, but with the *relationship* itself: that "an employee works on a project".

So the manager is related to the **Works_On** relationship, not directly to the employee or project entities.

Since this is not a simple relationship between entities, you use **aggregation**.

---

## Diagrammatically:

[Employee] ----

>--- (Works_On) ---- [Project]
/
[Manager]
|
(Manages)


Here, **Works_On** is a relationship, and the manager’s relation is with the **Works_On** relationship.  
So, we treat **Works_On** like an entity — this is aggregation.

---

## How to Convert Aggregation into Relational Tables?

We convert every entity and relationship into tables.

### Step 1: Create Tables for Entities

- **Employee**(`emp_id`, `name`, ...)  
- **Project**(`proj_id`, `title`, ...)  
- **Manager**(`mgr_id`, `name`, ...)

### Step 2: Create Table for Works_On Relationship

This table will represent which employee works on which project:

- **Works_On**(`emp_id`, `proj_id`, `hours`)

Here:  
- `emp_id` is a foreign key referencing **Employee**  
- `proj_id` is a foreign key referencing **Project**  
- `hours` is an attribute showing how many hours worked  

Primary key: (`emp_id`, `proj_id`)

### Step 3: Treat Aggregation as a Table

Now, there is a new relationship **Manages**, where:  
- The **Manager** is related to the *employee-project* pair defined by **Works_On**.

So we create a new table:

- **Manages**(`mgr_id`, `emp_id`, `proj_id`, `date`)

Here:  
- `mgr_id` is a foreign key referencing **Manager**  
- (`emp_id`, `proj_id`) is a foreign key referencing **Works_On** (or indirectly **Employee** + **Project**)  
- `date` is a descriptive attribute indicating since when the manager is managing this relationship

Primary key can be (`mgr_id`, `emp_id`, `proj_id`)

---

## Summary in Simple Terms

Aggregation means treating a relationship as an entity when you want to build another relationship on top of it.

When converting aggregation into tables:

- Create entity tables as usual.  
- Create relationship tables as usual.  
- Create a new table for the aggregation relationship, including:  
  - Primary keys of involved entities  
  - Any descriptive attributes related to that relationship

---

## Final Real-Life Story-Style Summary

Imagine you are a software engineer working on a project, and there is a project manager who tracks who is working on which project. Your work and project are on one side, and the manager manages this *work assignment*. The manager is not directly related to an employee or a project alone, but to the combination of the employee working on that project.

This is exactly what aggregation is — when you want to create a new relationship on top of an existing relationship.
