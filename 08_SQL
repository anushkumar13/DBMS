# Introduction to SQL and RDBMS

Imagine working in a library where there is a vast amount of data about books. To access and manage this data efficiently, you need a language that communicates with the database.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is a standard language used to interact with databases. Using SQL, you can insert, update, delete, or fetch data from a database.  

It is important to understand that SQL is **not a database itself**. Instead, it is a language used to communicate with databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and many others.

## CRUD Operations in SQL

When working with databases, there are four fundamental operations collectively called CRUD:

- **Create**: Adding new data to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieving or fetching data from the database.
- **Update**: Modifying existing data in the database.
- **Delete**: Removing data from the database.

These operations are performed using SQL commands that help manage the data efficiently.

## What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management System**.

It is software designed to manage relational databases, which organize data into tables consisting of rows and columns.

In simple terms:

- A **relational database** stores data in structured tables.
- An **RDBMS** is the software that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate these tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient access.

## Examples of Common RDBMS

Some popular RDBMS software include MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2.

## How RDBMS Works with SQL

When you write an SQL command (such as to insert or retrieve data), this command is sent to the RDBMS.

The RDBMS understands the command, interacts with the database storage, and returns the requested result or confirms the action.

For example, MySQL is an RDBMS that accepts SQL queries, processes them, and returns data accordingly.

## Data Storage in RDBMS

In an RDBMS, data is always stored in tables, also known as relations.

Each table consists of:

- **Rows** (also called tuples), which represent individual records.
- **Columns** (also called attributes), which represent data fields.

This tabular structure ensures data is organized and easily accessible.

## Client-Server Model in MySQL

MySQL operates using a client-server architecture:

- The **Client** is the application or tool where you write and send your SQL queries. This can be a command-line interface, a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench, or an application.
- The **Server** is the MySQL service running in the background, which receives, processes the queries, interacts with the database, and sends back the results to the client.

When a query is sent from the client, the server processes it and returns the output.

## Summary

- SQL is a **query language** used to communicate with databases, not a database itself.
- CRUD operations in SQL correspond to **Create (INSERT)**, **Read (SELECT)**, **Update (UPDATE)**, and **Delete (DELETE)** actions.
- RDBMS is software that implements the relational model by managing data stored in tables.
- MySQL is an example of an RDBMS that uses SQL for data management.
- MySQL follows a **client-server architecture** where the client sends queries and the server processes and responds.

# Difference Between SQL and MySQL Explained in Detail

Imagine you are running a restaurant.

- **SQL** is like the **menu card** through which you tell the chef what you want to eat — like "1 plate chowmein", "2 cold drinks", etc.
- **MySQL** is the entire **kitchen system** — where the chef, ingredients, stove, and everything else exist to take your order and prepare your food.

This is the basic difference.

---

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**.

It is a **language** that allows us to communicate with a database. Using SQL, we can:

- Create tables
- Insert, update, delete, or fetch data
- Apply constraints on data

Basically, all the work related to database structure and data manipulation is done using SQL.

**Important point:**  
SQL itself is **not a software**. It is just a set of instructions that we give to a database software.

---

## What is MySQL?

MySQL is an **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**.

It is a **software** that allows us to manage databases by executing SQL commands.

- You install MySQL on your system.
- Then you use SQL language to control and manipulate the database inside MySQL.
- MySQL has an engine that understands and processes your SQL queries.

**Important point:**  
MySQL is a software that **executes your SQL commands** and manages data stored in tables.

---

## Main Difference in One Line

- **SQL is a language**.  
- **MySQL is a software** that uses SQL to manage databases.

## Real Life Analogy

- **SQL** is like a language (Hindi/English) that you use to give instructions.  
- **MySQL** is like Google Translate, which reads that language and performs the actual work.

---

## Final Summary

- SQL is a **query language** used only for giving instructions to databases.  
- MySQL is an **RDBMS software** where you write SQL commands to manage data.  
- You install MySQL on your system, and then use SQL to interact with the databases inside MySQL.

# What Are SQL Data Types?

Whenever we create a table in SQL, we need to define the type of data each column will hold.

For example, in a column for Age, numbers will be stored,  
in a column for Name, alphabets or text will be stored,  
and in a column for Date of Birth, dates will be stored.

Specifying the data type for each column tells the SQL system what kind of data is allowed and what should be rejected.

---

## Categories of SQL Data Types

SQL data types are broadly categorized into three groups:

1. **Numeric Data Types** – used for storing numbers  
2. **String/Character Data Types** – used for storing text or characters  
3. **Date & Time Data Types** – used for storing date and time values

---

## 1. Numeric Data Types

These data types are used when only numbers need to be stored in a column, such as age, salary, score, etc.

- They include integers (whole numbers), fixed-point numbers, and floating-point numbers.  
- Numeric types ensure that only numerical data is accepted in that column.

---

## 2. String/Character Data Types

These types are used when the data stored is text or characters, like names, emails, or city names.

- They include fixed-length and variable-length text types.  
- Choosing the right string type helps in efficient storage and retrieval of text data.

---

## 3. Date & Time Data Types

These types are used when date, time, or both need to be recorded, such as birth dates, event times, or login timestamps.

- Different types exist to store just date, just time, both date and time, or automatically track system time when a record changes.

---

## Summary

SQL Data Types specify what kind of data can be stored in each column of a table.  

- **Numeric types** are for numbers.  
- **String types** are for text.  
- **Date/Time types** handle dates and times.  

Choosing the correct data type is essential for proper data validation and efficient use of memory.

# Types of SQL Commands

Imagine running a restaurant where you need to create tables, add data, delete data sometimes, and give permissions to staff. All this is done using different categories of SQL commands.

---

## 1. DDL – Data Definition Language

DDL commands define or modify the database structure or schema.

Think of DDL as **"Design and Define Language."**

These commands help you create new tables, databases, or views, modify existing tables, delete tables or databases, clear all data from a table but keep the structure, and rename database objects.

---

## 2. DRL / DQL – Data Retrieval Language

DRL or DQL commands are used only to **read or retrieve data** from the database.

This category typically contains just one command that fetches data from tables without modifying it.

---

## 3. DML – Data Manipulation Language

DML commands are used to **change the data** inside tables.

Think of DML as **“Data Mein Locha”** — commands that add, update, or delete data rows.

These commands allow you to insert new data, update existing data, or delete specific rows.

---

## 4. DCL – Data Control Language

DCL commands manage **access rights and permissions** on the database.

Think of DCL as **“Database Control Le Lo.”**

They let you grant permissions to users to perform specific actions and revoke those permissions when needed.

---

## 5. TCL – Transaction Control Language

TCL commands manage **database transactions** which are groups of operations executed together.

Think of TCL as **“Transaction ka Control Lo.”**

Transactions ensure that multiple related operations either complete entirely or don’t happen at all, maintaining data integrity.

These commands allow you to start a transaction, permanently save changes, undo changes if errors occur, and create checkpoints within transactions.

---

## Summary Table for Quick Revision

| Category | Full Form                   | Purpose                          | Common Commands                 |
|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| DDL      | Data Definition Language   | Define or modify database structure | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE  |
| DRL/DQL  | Data Retrieval Language    | Read or retrieve data only        | SELECT                         |
| DML      | Data Manipulation Language | Insert, update, delete data       | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE         |
| DCL      | Data Control Language      | Manage access rights and permissions | GRANT, REVOKE                |
| TCL      | Transaction Control Language | Manage database transactions     | COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT   |

---

## Real-Life Flow Using SQL Commands

- First, create the structure of your tables using DDL commands.  
- Add data into tables with DML commands.  
- Retrieve and view data using DRL commands.  
- Manage who can do what with DCL commands.  
- Control the safety and consistency of your operations using TCL commands.

# Managing Database Using DDL Commands

When we create a database, select which database to work on, delete a database, or list all available databases and tables on the server, we use DDL (Data Definition Language) commands. DDL commands help us control the structure of the database and create tables.

---

## Key DDL Commands for Database Management

### 1. Creating a Database

This command creates a new database with a specified name. It includes a condition to create the database only if it does not already exist. This prevents errors if the database is already present.

---

### 2. Selecting a Database to Work On

This command lets us choose which database on the server we want to operate on. After selecting a database, all subsequent operations like creating tables, inserting data, or running queries will happen inside that database. It allows easy switching between different databases.

---

### 3. Deleting a Database

This command deletes an entire database from the server, but only if the database exists. Deleting a database removes all tables and data inside it permanently, and this action cannot be undone.

---

### 4. Listing All Databases on the Server

This command shows a list of all databases currently available on the server. It helps us know what databases are present to work with.

---

### 5. Listing All Tables in the Selected Database

After selecting a specific database, this command lists all the tables inside that database. It helps us understand the structure and what tables we have to work with in that database.

---

## Summary

- **Create Database**: Used to make a new database.
- **Use Database**: Selects the database to work on.
- **Drop Database**: Deletes a complete database permanently.
- **Show Databases**: Lists all databases on the server.
- **Show Tables**: Lists all tables inside the currently selected database.

---

# Data Retrieval Language (DRL) - Detailed Explanation

The main purpose of Data Retrieval Language (DRL) is to retrieve data from the database, meaning extracting data by querying it. The most important command in DRL is **SELECT**.

---

## 1. SELECT Syntax

The **SELECT** command is used to fetch specific columns of data from a table. The `SELECT` keyword specifies which columns you want to retrieve, while the `FROM` clause tells which table to get the data from.

---

## 2. Order of Execution: Right to Left

When an SQL query runs, it logically executes from **right to left**:

- First, the `FROM` clause is executed to identify which table the data is coming from.
- Then, the `SELECT` clause is executed to specify which columns or expressions to retrieve from the selected table.

This means the database first locates the table, then picks the required columns.

---

## 3. Using SELECT Without FROM

It is possible to use the **SELECT** command without a `FROM` clause, but this works only when using a special dummy table called **DUAL**.

---

## 4. What is the DUAL Table?

**DUAL** is a dummy table automatically created internally by many database systems. It is used when you want to perform simple calculations or retrieve the result of functions without needing to query a real user-defined table.

This allows you to execute simple expressions, calculations, or system functions even if you do not have an actual table involved.

---

## 5. Summary

- **SELECT** is used to extract data from tables in the database.
- SQL queries logically execute from **right to left**, meaning the database first processes the `FROM` clause and then the `SELECT` clause.
- It is possible to use **SELECT without FROM** by using the **DUAL** table, which is a dummy table for simple calculations or function calls.
- This approach is helpful when no real table data is needed but results from expressions or system functions are required.

---

# SQL Clauses and Commands Explained in Detail

---

## 4. WHERE Clause

The **WHERE** clause is used to filter rows in a table based on specific conditions. It allows you to retrieve only those rows that satisfy the given condition.

---

## 5. BETWEEN Clause

The **BETWEEN** clause is used to specify a range for a column’s values. This range is inclusive, meaning it includes both the starting and ending values.

---

## 6. IN Clause

The **IN** clause is used to simplify multiple OR conditions by checking if a value exists within a specified list. It helps in filtering rows where the column’s value matches any value from the list.

---

## 7. AND / OR / NOT Logical Operators

These logical operators combine multiple conditions in SQL queries:

- **AND**: Both conditions must be true.
- **OR**: At least one condition must be true.
- **NOT**: Negates a condition, selecting rows where the condition is false.

---

## 8. IS NULL

The **IS NULL** condition is used to find rows where a particular column has no assigned value, i.e., the column’s value is NULL.

---

## 9. Pattern Searching / Wildcards (‘%’, ‘_’)

- **%** wildcard represents any number of characters (including zero characters).
- **_** wildcard represents exactly one character.

These wildcards are used with the **LIKE** clause for pattern matching in string data.

---

## 10. ORDER BY Clause

The **ORDER BY** clause is used to sort the retrieved data based on one or more columns. Sorting can be done in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. The default sorting order is ascending if not specified.

---

## 11. GROUP BY Clause

The **GROUP BY** clause divides data into groups based on specified columns. Rows with the same values in those columns form one group. It is commonly used with aggregation functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX. All columns in the SELECT statement, except the aggregated ones, must be included in the GROUP BY clause.

**Common Aggregation Functions:**

- **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows.
- **SUM()**: Calculates the total sum of column values.
- **AVG()**: Finds the average value.
- **MIN()**: Finds the minimum value.
- **MAX()**: Finds the maximum value.

---

## 12. DISTINCT Keyword

The **DISTINCT** keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a column, removing duplicate entries. It performs a similar function to using GROUP BY on the same column.

---

## Summary

In SQL, the **WHERE** clause is used to filter data. **BETWEEN**, **IN**, **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** provide logical and range-based filtering options. **IS NULL** helps find rows with missing values. Pattern searching is done using wildcards `%` and `_`. The **ORDER BY** clause sorts data, while **GROUP BY** groups data for aggregation purposes. Lastly, **DISTINCT** retrieves unique values by eliminating duplicates.

---

# GROUP BY and HAVING Clause in SQL

---

## GROUP BY Recap

The **GROUP BY** clause groups rows that have similar values into categories. It is commonly used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, etc., to perform calculations on each group.

---

## HAVING Clause – The Filter After GROUP BY

The **HAVING** clause is used to filter groups created by the GROUP BY clause. It allows you to specify conditions on aggregated data, filtering groups based on those conditions.

---

## Difference Between WHERE and HAVING

Both **WHERE** and **HAVING** are used to filter data, but they differ in when and how they are applied:

| Aspect                   | WHERE                          | HAVING                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| When it is applied       | Before grouping (on raw rows)  | After grouping (on grouped data) |
| What it filters          | Individual rows                | Groups (aggregated data)       |
| Used with aggregate functions? | No                       | Yes                          |
| Used with GROUP BY       | Not necessarily               | Mostly required               |

---

# DDL Constraints in SQL

Constraints are rules applied on columns to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data stored in the database.

---

## Primary Key (PK)

A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each row in a table. 

- Each table can have only one primary key.
- The primary key column cannot have NULL values.
- Duplicate values are not allowed in the primary key column.

---

## Foreign Key (FK)

A **Foreign Key** links two tables together by referring to the primary key in another table.

- A table can have multiple foreign keys.
- It ensures that the value inserted exists in the referenced primary key column of the other table.

---

## UNIQUE Constraint

The **UNIQUE** constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.

- Unlike primary keys, NULL values are allowed.
- Multiple columns in a table can have UNIQUE constraints.

---

## CHECK Constraint

The **CHECK** constraint validates the data by specifying a condition that the values must satisfy before insertion.

- It enforces rules on column values to maintain data integrity.

---

## Quick Recap

- **GROUP BY** groups data into categories.
- **HAVING** filters those grouped categories.
- **WHERE** filters raw data before grouping.
- **Primary Key** = unique + not null + only one per table.
- **Foreign Key** = refers to primary key in another table.
- **UNIQUE** = no duplicates allowed, but NULL allowed.
- **CHECK** = enforces validation rules on column data.

---

# SQL DDL – DEFAULT, ALTER Operations & PK-FK Combination

---

## DEFAULT Constraint – Automatic Value When None Provided

The **DEFAULT** constraint automatically assigns a predefined value to a column when no explicit value is provided during insertion. It saves time and effort by avoiding repeated manual input of the same value for multiple rows.

---

## Can a Single Attribute Be Both Primary Key and Foreign Key?

Yes, an attribute can be both a **Primary Key (PK)** and a **Foreign Key (FK)** at the same time.

This happens when a column uniquely identifies rows in its own table (PK) while also referring to the primary key of another table (FK). This ensures that every value in the column exists in the referenced table and remains unique within its own table.

---

## ALTER TABLE Operations – Modifying Table Structure After Creation

The **ALTER** command lets you change the structure of an existing table without deleting it. It is like making modifications to a house after it's built — adding rooms, changing paint, renaming things, or removing parts.

---

### ADD – Add New Columns

You can add one or more new columns to an existing table using the ADD operation.

---

### MODIFY – Change Column Data Type

MODIFY is used to change the data type or size of an existing column.

---

### CHANGE COLUMN – Rename Column and Change Data Type

CHANGE COLUMN allows you to rename a column and change its data type at the same time. The data type must be specified during this operation.

---

### DROP COLUMN – Remove a Column Permanently

DROP COLUMN deletes a column from the table, and this action is irreversible. Once dropped, the data in that column is lost.

---

### RENAME – Change the Table Name

RENAME changes the entire table’s name to a new one.

---

## Quick Recap

- **DEFAULT** sets an automatic value for a column if no value is provided.
- A column can be **both Primary Key and Foreign Key** if the design requires it.
- **ALTER** lets you modify the table structure without deleting the table.
- **ADD** adds new columns.
- **MODIFY** changes the data type of existing columns.
- **CHANGE COLUMN** renames a column and modifies its data type.
- **DROP COLUMN** deletes a column permanently.
- **RENAME** changes the name of the whole table.

---

# SQL DML Operations – INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REPLACE & Cascade Actions

---

## 1. INSERT – Adding New Data into a Table

The **INSERT** command is used to add new rows of data into a table. You can insert one or multiple rows in a single query. It is important that the order of columns and the corresponding values match while inserting data.

---

## 2. UPDATE – Modifying Existing Data

The **UPDATE** command modifies existing records in a table based on a specified condition. If the condition matches multiple rows, all those rows will be updated. Using UPDATE without a WHERE clause will update every row in the table, which can be risky.

---

## 3. DELETE – Removing Data from a Table

The **DELETE** command removes rows from a table based on a condition. If no WHERE clause is provided, all rows in the table will be deleted, but the table structure remains intact.

---

## 4. REPLACE – Hybrid of Insert and Update

The **REPLACE** statement works as a combination of insert and update. If a row with the same primary key or unique key exists, the existing row is deleted and replaced with the new row. If no conflict exists, it simply inserts the new row. Note that REPLACE triggers DELETE and INSERT actions internally.

---

## 5. ON UPDATE CASCADE – Automatic Child Update When Parent Key Changes

When a foreign key references a primary key in another table, the **ON UPDATE CASCADE** option ensures that if the parent key is updated, the related foreign key in the child table is automatically updated as well.

---

## 6. ON DELETE CASCADE – Automatic Child Deletion When Parent is Deleted

The **ON DELETE CASCADE** option ensures that when a record in the parent table is deleted, all corresponding rows in the child table referencing that record are automatically deleted to maintain referential integrity.

---

## 7. ON DELETE SET NULL – Setting Child Foreign Key to NULL When Parent is Deleted

With the **ON DELETE SET NULL** option, when a parent record is deleted, the corresponding foreign key fields in the child table are set to NULL instead of deleting the child records.

---

## Summary

- **INSERT** adds new rows to a table.
- **UPDATE** changes existing data based on conditions.
- **DELETE** removes rows based on conditions.
- **REPLACE** deletes and inserts rows when a primary or unique key conflict occurs.
- **ON UPDATE CASCADE** updates child foreign keys automatically when the parent key changes.
- **ON DELETE CASCADE** deletes child rows automatically when the parent row is deleted.
- **ON DELETE SET NULL** sets child foreign keys to NULL when the parent row is deleted.

---

# Joining Tables in DBMS – Detailed Explanation

---

## 1. Nature of RDBMS – Relational

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System, which means data is stored in tables related to each other through defined relationships. These relationships are established using **Foreign Keys (FK)**, where a column in one table refers to the Primary Key of another table. This allows tables to be logically connected and data to be combined efficiently.

---

## 2. INNER JOIN – Most Common Join

**INNER JOIN** returns only those rows where there is a matching value in both joined tables. It filters data to show records that have related entries in both tables based on the join condition.

---

## 3. Aliases in SQL (AS Keyword)

Aliases are temporary alternative names used to simplify queries, especially when dealing with long table or column names. Aliases make queries shorter, cleaner, and easier to read. There are two types of aliases:

- **Column Alias:** Gives a temporary name to a column in the output.
- **Table Alias:** Assigns a temporary name to a table to avoid repeatedly writing long table names.

---

## 4. OUTER JOIN – Returns Data Even If There Is No Match

- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table, along with matched rows from the right table. If no match exists, NULL values fill the right table columns.
  
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table, along with matched rows from the left table. If no match exists, NULL values fill the left table columns.

- **FULL JOIN:** Returns all rows from both tables, matching where possible. Rows without matches in the other table are included with NULLs. Note that some databases like MySQL do not support FULL JOIN directly, so it is simulated by combining LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN using UNION.

---

## 5. CROSS JOIN – Cartesian Product

**CROSS JOIN** returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row of the first table is combined with every row of the second table. This can result in a very large number of rows and is rarely used in practical applications.

---

## 6. SELF JOIN – Joining a Table with Itself

A **SELF JOIN** is used when a table needs to be joined with itself. This is useful in scenarios like hierarchical data where, for example, an employee and their manager both exist in the same table. Aliases are used to differentiate between the two instances of the same table in the query.

---

## 7. Join Without Using JOIN Keyword (Old Style)

In older SQL syntax, joins were performed by listing tables separated by commas and specifying join conditions in the WHERE clause. Though this method still works, modern SQL prefers using explicit JOIN keywords because it is clearer and more readable.

---

## Summary

- **RDBMS** stores data in related tables connected via foreign keys.
- **INNER JOIN** returns rows with matching data in both tables.
- **Aliases** simplify and clarify queries by giving temporary names.
- **OUTER JOIN** returns all data from one or both tables even if no match exists.
- **CROSS JOIN** creates combinations of all rows from both tables.
- **SELF JOIN** joins a table with itself for hierarchical or related data within the same table.
- Old-style joins using commas and WHERE clause are outdated but still valid.

---

# Set Operations in SQL – Detailed Explanation

---

## What Are Set Operations in SQL?

Set operations in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. This is useful when you want to merge data from multiple queries, similar to how sets work in mathematics, such as UNION, INTERSECT, and DIFFERENCE (EXCEPT/MINUS).

---

## Common Rules for All Set Operations

- The number of columns selected in each query must be the same.
- The data types of corresponding columns must match.
- The order of the columns must also be the same.

---

## 1. UNION

**Purpose:**  
UNION combines the results of two queries and returns only unique rows. If the same row appears in both queries, it appears once in the result.

---

## 2. UNION ALL

**Purpose:**  
UNION ALL is similar to UNION, but it includes all duplicate rows as well. It is faster because it does not perform the extra step of filtering out duplicates.

---

## 3. INTERSECT

**Purpose:**  
INTERSECT returns only the rows that are common to both queries. It shows the intersection of the two result sets.

**Note:**  
Some databases like MySQL do not support INTERSECT directly. In such cases, the same effect can be achieved using INNER JOIN or subqueries.

---

## 4. EXCEPT / MINUS

**Purpose:**  
EXCEPT (or MINUS in some databases) returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query. It shows the difference between the two result sets.

- EXCEPT is used in PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
- MINUS is used in Oracle.
- MySQL does not support EXCEPT or MINUS directly, and similar functionality can be achieved using subqueries.

---

## Important Note on Column Names

The final result set will take the column names from the first SELECT query in the operation.

---

## Practical Usage

In real-world applications, UNION and UNION ALL are most commonly used. INTERSECT and EXCEPT/MINUS are less frequently used and sometimes need to be simulated in databases that do not support them directly.

---

# Subqueries in SQL – Detailed Explanation

---

## What is a Subquery?

A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL query. It is also called a nested query because one query is written inside another query.

---

## Basic Idea

A subquery is used when the outer query depends on the result of the inner query. The inner query produces an intermediate result that the outer query uses.

---

## Alternative to Joins

When we want to relate data from multiple tables, we usually use JOINs. However, sometimes joins can become complex or when a specific result is needed, subqueries can be used as an alternative for better readability or simplicity.

---

## Where Subqueries Are Used

1. **In the WHERE Clause:**  
   The most common place to use subqueries. The outer query uses the result from the inner query as a filter condition.

2. **In the FROM Clause:**  
   The subquery acts like a temporary table or derived table, which the outer query can use as a source.

3. **In the SELECT Clause:**  
   Used to fetch a specific value for each row selected by the outer query, allowing you to calculate or retrieve related data inline.

---

## Derived Subquery (Temporary Table)

When the result of a subquery is treated as a new temporary table for the outer query, it is called a derived subquery. This helps in breaking complex queries into manageable parts.

---

## Correlated Subquery (Advanced)

A correlated subquery is a special type of subquery where the inner query depends on the outer query’s current row. This means the inner query runs repeatedly for each row processed by the outer query. It creates a row-by-row dependency between the outer and inner queries.

---

## Important Points to Remember

- A subquery is always enclosed in parentheses.
- The subquery result is used only by the outer query.
- Derived and correlated subqueries are more advanced forms of subqueries.
- Anything achievable with a subquery can also be done using JOINs, but subqueries often provide better readability in certain situations.

# Join vs Subqueries – Detailed Explanation

---

## What is a Join?

A Join is an SQL operation used to combine data from two or more tables. It is used when we want related data from multiple tables together. In a Join, tables are connected based on a common column, usually a Primary Key-Foreign Key relationship. The result is a new table that contains matching rows from the joined tables, depending on the type of join used.

---

## What is a Subquery?

A Subquery is a query written inside another query. It uses the result of the inner query as an intermediate value for the outer query. Subqueries are mostly used when we want complex filtering or nested logic that might be difficult to achieve using joins. The result of a subquery acts as a value or subset of data for the outer query.

## Why are Join and Subquery Used Differently?

| Aspect               | Join                                          | Subquery                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose              | Combine data from multiple tables together    | Use the result of one query inside another query  |
| Result               | Produces a combined result table               | Provides filtering or data subset to the outer query |
| Performance          | Generally faster for large datasets            | Sometimes slower, especially with correlated subqueries |
| Readability          | Complex join queries can be hard to understand | Subqueries can be more readable for simple nested logic |
| Data Retrieval Style | Combines data horizontally by merging columns | Used for filtering or calculating data             |
| Use in Filtering     | Mainly used to fetch related data               | Useful for conditional filtering or nested logic  |
| When Preferred       | When tables are directly related and combined results are needed | When conditional filtering or intermediate calculations are required |

## Pros and Cons of Join and Subquery

### Join Pros

- Faster performance for large datasets due to single data fetch.
- Efficient for complex queries.
- Provides a combined result with multiple columns, easy to compare.

### Join Cons

- Incorrect join conditions can produce wrong or duplicate data.
- Complex joins can be difficult to understand.

### Subquery Pros

- Makes queries modular and improves readability.
- Very useful for conditional filtering, especially with nested calculations.
- More helpful when table relationships are complicated.

### Subquery Cons

- Correlated subqueries can be slow as the inner query runs repeatedly.
- Can be inefficient for large datasets.
- Sometimes requires writing more lines of code.

---

## Correlated Subquery vs Join

In correlated subqueries, the inner query runs for each row of the outer query, which can cause performance issues. Joins perform the operation once, making them generally more efficient.

---

## Summary

Use **Join** when you need a combined result from multiple related tables with matching rows.

Use **Subquery** when you need filtering or intermediate calculations based on specific conditions.

Both have their pros and cons, so the choice depends on the specific situation and requirements.

# MySQL Views – Detailed Explanation

---

## What is a View?

A View is a virtual table that is created based on the data of actual tables. It does not store data physically; instead, it is the result of a saved SQL query. When you query a view, the database runs the underlying query and returns the result, just like querying the original tables directly.

---

## Purpose of Views

Views serve several important purposes:

- **Simplify Complex Queries:** If you have to run a complex query repeatedly, you can save it as a view and reuse it easily.
- **Security:** Views allow hiding sensitive columns from users by exposing only specific columns.
- **Data Abstraction:** They provide a simplified interface to users by hiding the actual structure of tables.
- **Reusability:** Once created, views can be used repeatedly in different queries without rewriting the complex logic.

---

## How to Create Views?

Views are created by defining a SQL query and saving it with a name. This saved query acts as the virtual table whenever the view is queried.

---

## How to Use Views?

Views can be queried just like normal tables to retrieve the data defined by the underlying query.

---

## Updating Views

Views are usually read-only, meaning you cannot directly insert, update, or delete data through them. However, simple views that are based on a single table and do not involve complex joins or aggregations may allow updates in some cases. Complex views that involve multiple tables or aggregations are generally not updateable.

---

## Modifying or Deleting Views

To modify a view, you first drop the existing view and then create a new one with the updated query. Alternatively, in MySQL, you can use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement to overwrite an existing view with a new definition.

---

## Types of Views

- **Simple Views:** Created from a single table without joins or aggregations. These views are usually updateable.
- **Complex Views:** Created by joining multiple tables or using groupings and aggregation functions. These views are typically read-only.

---

## Advantages of Views

- Simplify complex queries by providing an easy-to-use query interface.
- Enhance security by hiding sensitive data.
- Help maintain data consistency and backward compatibility if underlying table structures change.
- Promote reuse by eliminating the need to rewrite complex queries repeatedly.

---

## Limitations of Views

- Since views do not store data physically, performance may be slower for heavy or complex queries.
- Updating views that involve complex operations can be difficult or impossible.
- Implementation and behavior of views can vary between database systems, which may affect portability.

---

## Summary

Views provide a powerful way to simplify, secure, and reuse SQL queries by creating virtual tables that represent complex data relationships without storing data physically. They help abstract complexity and enforce security, but come with some performance and update limitations depending on their complexity.
