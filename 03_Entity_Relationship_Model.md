# Data Model in DBMS

I will explain it to you in a story-style with real-life examples â€” so that you never forget it. This concept is the core base of DBMS, and once this is clear, understanding further topics will become much easier ğŸ’ª

## First of all â€” What is a Data Model?

Think of DBMS as a world where data lives. Now, in this world, how to represent data, how to make relationships between data, how to organize it, and how to access it â€” all this is explained by the Data Model.

### Simple Definition:
A Data Model is a way in which data is defined with structure (form), semantics (meaning), and constraints (rules).

### Real Life Analogy â€“ "Lego Blocks"
Imagine you have many Lego blocks (these blocks = data). Now you want to organize these blocks into a building, car, or castle.

You have some rules:

- Which block can connect to which block
- What structure you can build
- Which color should be in which part

These rules and structure that you follow â€” that is your Data Model!
Meaning how to design data and define its relationships, that is decided by the Data Model.

## Types of Data Models in DBMS:
There are mainly 3 types of Data Models used in DBMS:

### 1. High-Level Data Models
(Also called Conceptual Models)

- Used when the user or business analyst needs to design real-world data.
- Example: ER Model (Entity Relationship Model) â€” where entities, attributes, and relationships are defined.
- Real World: "Student", "Course", "Teacher" â€” these are entities.
- "Student enrolls in Course" â€” this is a relationship.
- Goal: Should be human-readable.
- Focus on what the data is, not how it is stored.

### 2. Representational Data Models
(Also called Logical Models)

- Used when data needs to be shown in a more computer-friendly form.
- Most Popular: Relational Model (table-based)
- Example:

| Student_ID | Name  | Age |
|------------|--------|-----|
| 101        | Anush  | 20  |
| 102        | Rahul  | 21  |

- Real World: This model shows how data is stored in tables.
- Columns = attributes
- Rows = records
- Goal: Should be readable for users and processable for machines.

### 3. Low-Level Data Models
(Also called Physical Models)

- Used when data needs to be modeled at the physical storage level (how data will be saved on disk, indexing, memory allocation).
- Example:
  - How data will be allocated in disk blocks?
  - Which field will have an index?
  - Will B-trees or hashing be used?
- Real World: This model is used by database administrators (DBA) for optimization.
- Goal: Improve performance and optimize storage.

## Summary Table:

| Level       | Name                  | Focus                    | Example                   |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| High-Level  | Conceptual Data Model  | User View / Real World   | ER Diagram (Student-Course) |
| Mid-Level   | Logical Data Model     | Table-based Structure    | Relational Model (SQL Tables) |
| Low-Level   | Physical Data Model    | Hardware Storage Details | Disk Blocks, Indexes      |

## Flow of Data Models in Real Life:
- Conceptual Model: "We have Students, Courses, and Teachers." (Business-level design)
- Logical Model: "Letâ€™s make tables: Student(Name, ID), Course(Name, Code), etc." (Table structure with foreign keys)
- Physical Model: "Store 'Student' table on disk with B+ tree index on ID." (Low-level storage detail)

## Real World Story Example:
Flipkart decided:

- Conceptual: Customers, Orders, Products. Customer places order â†’ Order contains Products.
- Logical: Tables created: Customers, Orders, Products, Order_Details.
- Physical: Index created on Order_ID. Tables distributed on different servers.

Your search runs fast because the data model behind it is smartly designed! ğŸ”¥

## Conclusion:
Data Model = Design + Structure + Rules to manage data.

- High-level â†’ Real world view (ER model)
- Logical level â†’ Table-based view (Relational model)
- Physical level â†’ Actual storage implementation

# ER Model (Entity Relationship Model)

The ER Model can be called the "mother" of DBMS because before building any database, the very first task is to create an ER Model. This concept is so important that without understanding it, you cannot even start designing a relational database.

Today, I will explain it to you in a story-style manner, with examples from around the world, starting from zero and going all the way to rocket level understanding.

## What is an ER Model?

### Basic Definition:
An ER Model is a high-level conceptual data model that represents real-world entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

This model was created by Peter Chen in 1976 with the purpose of:

- Making database design human-friendly
- Showing a blueprint of the system before actually building tables

---

## Real-Life Analogy â€“ "The World of Flipkart"

Imagine Flipkart is a world.

In this world, there are:

- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- Delivery Boys

Now, you have to think about who is what and how they are connected.

So what will you do? You will create a diagram where:

- Every real-world object is represented (like "Customer", "Order")
- Connections between them are shown (like "Customer places Order")

This diagram is called the ER Model.

---

## Goal of ER Model:

Before making the database, it should give a clear view of:

- What all entities are there in the data
- What data (attributes) they will have
- How they are related to each other

So that later when you create tables (relational schema), they map perfectly.

## Core Components of ER Model:

Let's understand each component step by step:

### 1. Entity (Faces or Objects)

**What is it?**  
An entity is any real-world thing about which you want to store data.

**Examples:**  
Student, Teacher, Course, Car, Product, Order, Customer

**Two Types of Entities:**

- **Strong Entity:**  
  Has its own unique identity (like Student has Roll Number)

- **Weak Entity:**  
  Cannot exist alone.  
  Depends on some other strong entity.  
  Example: "Dependent" of Employee (like children of an employee)  
  If the Employee is deleted, the dependent loses meaning.

---

### 2. Attributes (Features or Properties of Entity)

**What is it?**  
Specific information stored about an entity is called an attribute.

**Examples:**  
For Student: Name, Roll No, Age, Email  
For Product: Product_ID, Price, Name

**Types of Attributes:**

- Simple Attribute â€“ indivisible (Name, Age)
- Composite Attribute â€“ can be broken down (Name = First Name + Last Name)
- Derived Attribute â€“ calculated (Age from DOB)
- Multivalued Attribute â€“ multiple values (Phone Numbers)

---

### 3. Relationships (Connections Between Entities)

**What is it?**  
When two or more entities are connected in some way, that bond is called a relationship.

**Examples:**  
Student enrolls in Course  
Customer places Order  
Employee manages Department

**Types of Relationships:**

- One to One (1:1)  
  One entity â†’ one other  
  Example: One Person has One AadharCard

- One to Many (1:N)  
  One entity â†’ many others  
  Example: One Teacher teaches many Students

- Many to Many (M:N)  
  Many of one â†’ many of another  
  Example: Students enroll in many Courses & Courses have many Students

---

### 4. Keys (Identifiers)

**What is it?**  
The attribute used to uniquely identify an entity is called the Key Attribute.

**Examples:**  
Student's Roll Number  
Product's Product_ID

In ER diagrams, keys are underlined.

---

### 5. Participation

- **Total Participation:**  
  Every entity must participate in the relationship.  
  Example: Every Order must be placed by a Customer.

- **Partial Participation:**  
  Some entities may participate, some may not.  
  Example: Some Students may not have registered in any course.

---

## Sample ER Diagram â€“ "University System"

Imagine a University system with:

- Entities:  
  Student â†’ (Roll_No, Name, Age)  
  Course â†’ (Course_ID, Name, Credits)  
  Teacher â†’ (Teacher_ID, Name, Subject)

- Relationships:  
  Student ENROLLS IN Course  
  Teacher TEACHES Course

The ER Diagram would look like:

```
[Student] --enrolls in--> [Course] <--teaches-- [Teacher]
```

With attributes:

- Student: Roll_No (key), Name, Age  
- Course: Course_ID (key), Name, Credits

---

## How ER Model Helps in Real Projects?

### Real Example: Flipkart

- Entities: User, Order, Product, Seller  
- Relationships: User places Order, Order contains Product, Seller sells Product

All these things are first designed in the ER Model, and then the database tables are created based on it.
